										<h3>Gabrielle Erftenbeck</h3>
									</header>
									<p>Hello there! Welcome to Where’s Gogo — my personal blog for travel, lifestyle and all things Gogo.</p>
									<p>Speaking of which, let me introduce myself. I’m Gabrielle Erftenbeck, but you can call me Gogo. I recently graduated from Purdue University’s Hospitality and Tourism Management program with a minor in International Studies. Since graduating I have been working as a travel agent sending myself and others to experience new things all over the globe.</p>
									<p>Before college started I really had no idea what I wanted to study — I just knew that I was passionate about working with and helping people. After learning that HTM was an actual major, I knew it was something I could see myself doing.</p>
									<p>Throughout my studies I worked various hotel, restaurant and event planning jobs trying to find what I was most passionate about. Eventually I did, all thanks to China.</p>
									<p>After my sophomore year, I set off to study abroad in Guangzhou, China, for six months. While there, I learned, both professionally and personally, more than I had up until that point in university. I was working in the beautiful five-star Shangri-La Guangzhou. Although this was one of the best experiences of my life — I met so many people from all around the world with so many different backgrounds and walks of life — I was no longer intrigued by the hotel industry. I wanted to continue to meet new people from different cultures and learn their way of life… I wanted to travel.</p>
									<p>...</p>
									<p>When I’m not working or traveling, you’ll probably find me in the sun enjoying a craft beer, planning my next adventure, listening to tunes on the go or curling up to my knits with a good Netflix episode.</p>
