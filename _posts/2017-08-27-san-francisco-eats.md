My boyfriend and I went to San Francisco during Christmas this past year, and boy did we eat! I’ve been reminiscing about this trip recently and thinking of all the tasty foods we had so I decided I’d share some of my favorites (in no particular order).

# 1. Burma Love. 
I think back to this meal often as it was my absolute favorite from the trip. Located on Valencia St, this Burmese delight will have you leaving stuffed but still wanting more. I’d recommend going with a group because the entrees are meant to be shared. The more the merrier (and the more you get to try)! I had never had Burmese food so I didn't know quite what to expect — think flavor, delicious curries and all around YUM. If you’re in the bay area, be sure to show some love to Burma Love.

What to try: The eggplant curry was an all-around favorite as well as the platha & dip (to die for). Honestly, everything was good so you can’t go wrong.

# 2. Namu Gaji. 
This asian inspired restaurant is incredible for many reasons. First, it is ran by three brothers who also own Namu Farm which is where a lot of their local, organic ingredients come from. Second, the decor and ambiance. The woodwork throughout the restaurant gives it a warm, welcoming vibe. Especially if you get to sit in the community table located in the center of the restaurant. Oh, and obviously the food.

**What to try:** KFC (Korean Fried Chicken, that is). This stuff is to die for. However, there’s a catch. It’s only served on Wednesdays, so plan accordingly! If you aren’t able to make it on a KFC night, it is still well worth it. We enjoyed all of the dishes we ordered and shared (can you tell I like sharing?)

# 3. Craftsman and Wolves. 
This pastry shop is the real deal. Seriously. Picture this — you bite into a fresh muffin to find a perfectly gooey soft boiled egg in the very center, creating the taste of a full breakfast all in one bite. Truly magical. The muffin is savory with cheese, sausage, chives, etc, but the egg really ties everything together and brings a good consistency to your b-fast.

What to try: the Rebel Within

# 4. Trouble Coffee Company. 
I’m glad Colin and I took the time to visit this place (located in Outer Sunset). If you have the time for a slower-paced-yet-eventful morning I recommend gettin’ into some Trouble. We took our food to go since this place is smaller with only a few high top chairs. Plus, it’s just a short walk to the beach! This is the type of neighborhood coffee joint I want to be a regular at someday. They are infamous for their toast for good reason — thick, perfectly crisp and covered in butter and cinnamon n’ sugar.

What to try: Cinnamon and sugar toast, a warm beverage and a walk on sunset beach with an afternoon visit to Japanese Tea Gardens

# 5. Dim Sum in Chinatown. 
This isn’t a restaurant-specific suggestion, but it needs to be said. Whenever you are in a city with a Chinatown, you get dim sum. Since San Francisco’s Chinatown is one of the largest and most famous in the US, it was mandatory we had our fill. In fact, we ate two dinners this day so we could fit in all of our food fixes for this trip. Tip: scope out a place where most of the patrons are Chinese - this means you are in the right place. If the menu is in Chinese, then you are definitely in the right place - just order by the pictures or what looks good passing by.

What to try: my absolute favorite dim sum dish is Siu Mai 燒賣 . A pork and shrimp open-faced dumpling full of flavor
