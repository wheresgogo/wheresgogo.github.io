First off, I don't blame you if your mind first thought of Gogo girls and/or boots, O-Ren's badass bodyguard in Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction (RIP) or any other weird connotation my name has. Trust me, I’m used to having some 'splainin' to do after introducing myself.

Well it started when I was around two years old and my parents were teaching me how to say my real name, Gabrielle. During this rough time in my life of learning how to say a rather difficult name and having a mother who refused to let anyone call me “Gabby” I began to pronounce my name as “Gus”. However, my parents persisted (thank goodness) and as I grew out of my Gus Phase, I entered the Gogo Phase! What’s cuter than a confident, mullet haired 2 year old (plz see photo below) running around calling themselves Gogo? I could probably just stop the story here…

However, it continues! Soon after, during a family reunion of my mom’s family she called me over to my great uncle Dick and told me to tell him my new nickname. I proudly told him “Gogo” and he suddenly ran away into the house… (One thing you should know about uncle Dick; he was the genealogist of the family- shoutout Uncle Dick!). After standing there puzzled for a few minutes thinking he left us hanging, he rejoined my mom and I with a photo album in hand. He flipped through the pages and opened it to show us a woman in nurse garments serving in World War II. Georgian was her name. “That is your Auntie Gogo, Gogo” Uncle Dick said.

It is safe to say I have been Gogo ever since. Also, shoutout to my mama for being such a (good) story teller and making sure I never forgot the long-version story of how my name as Gogo came to be.
